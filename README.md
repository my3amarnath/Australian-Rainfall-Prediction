# Rainfall Prediction in Australia

## Objective
Classification project in Python. Our objective is to use a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithms to the data.

## Algorithms to build your models:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM

## The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score

## Introduction to Data set

For the purposes of this example, we're using a dataset that has a relatively small number of predictors in each record.

The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.

The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData

This dataset contains observations of weather metrics for each day from 2008 to 2017. The **weatherAUS.csv** dataset includes the following fields:

| Field         | Description                                           | Unit            | Type   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------ |
| Date          | Date of the Observation in YYYY-MM-DD                 | Date            | object |

| RainToday     | If there was rain today                               | Yes/No          | object |
| RainTomorrow  | If there is rain tomorrow                             | Yes/No          | float  |
